<h2 class= 'who'>Who am I?</h2>	
	
	<p>Hello! I am a Developer and programmer with experience in website and software development. My passion for coding began when I was a 1st Year student in Adamson University, and I have been pursuing it ever since. I am proficient in Web Development such as HTML, CSS and I have knowledge in Wordpress and I also have various knowledge in programming languages such as Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript, and I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies.

As a web designer, my main goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that effectively communicate my clients' brand and message. I understand the importance of designing websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional, with a focus on user experience (UX) design.

To achieve this, I am proficient in a variety of design tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, and Figma. I also have a strong understanding of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to design with technical constraints in mind.
</p>
<br>
<p>I am also a content creator with a deep understanding of SEO and email marketing. My passion for creating high-quality content that resonates with my audience began several years ago, and I have been honing my skills ever since.

As a content creator, I understand the importance of creating content that is both informative and engaging. I have experience writing blog posts, social media posts, videos, and podcasts, and I am always exploring new content formats to stay ahead of the curve. I am skilled in creating content that is optimized for search engines, ensuring that my clients' websites rank well in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<br>
<p>One of my strengths as a programmer is my ability to solve complex problems. I enjoy breaking down a problem into smaller components and figuring out the best way to approach each one. I am also detail-oriented and thorough in my work, ensuring that every line of code I write is efficient and effective.

In addition to my technical skills, I also value collaboration and communication. I believe that teamwork is essential in any successful project, and I enjoy working with others to achieve a common goal. I am also skilled in explaining technical concepts in layman's terms, which makes me an effective communicator with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Overall, I am a dedicated and passionate Developer/Programmer who is always striving to improve my skills and knowledge. I look forward to working with others to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. </p>
